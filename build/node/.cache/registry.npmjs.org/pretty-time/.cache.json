Works with timescales ranging from weeks to nanoseconds.\n\nPlease consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save pretty-time\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar pretty = require('pretty-time');\n\nvar start = process.hrtime();\nvar time = process.hrtime(start);\nconsole.log(pretty(time));\n//=> 3μs\n```\n\n## API\n\nBy default, when no time increment is given as the second argument, the closest timescale is used (e.g. _most granular without being less than zero_).\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```js\npretty([1200708, 795428088]);\n//=> '2w'\n\npretty([800708, 795428088]);\n//=> '1w'\n\npretty([400708, 795428088]);\n//=> '5d'\n\npretty([70708, 795428088]);\n//=> '20h'\n\npretty([12708, 795428088]);\n//=> '4h'\n\npretty([3708, 795428088]);\n//=> '1h'\n\npretty([208, 795428088]);\n//=> '3m'\n\npretty([20, 795428088]);\n//=> '21s'\n\npretty([0, 795428088]);\n//=> '795ms'\n\npretty([0, 000428088]);\n//=> '428μs'\n\npretty([0, 000000088]);\n//=> '88ns'\n\npretty([0, 000000018]);\n//=> '18ns'\n```\n\n### Minimum time increment\n\n_(All of the following examples use `[6740, 795428088]` as the hrtime array.)_\n\nThis value is passed as the second argument and determines how granular to make the time.\n\n**Examples**\n\n```js\npretty(time, 'h');\n//=> '2h'\n\npretty(time, 'm');\n//=> '1h 52m'\n\npretty(time, 's');\n//=> '1h 52m 21s'\n```\n\n**Valid time increments**\n\nAny of the following may be used:\n\n* `ns` | `nano` | `nanosecond` | `nanoseconds`\n* `μs` | `micro` | `microsecond` | `microseconds`\n* `ms` | `milli` | `millisecond` | `milliseconds`\n* `s` | `sec` | `second` | `seconds`\n* `m` | `min` | `minute` | `minutes`\n* `h` | `hr` | `hour` | `hours`\n* `d` | `day` | `days`\n* `w` | `wk` | `week` | `weeks`\n\n## About\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Contributing</strong></summary>\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
